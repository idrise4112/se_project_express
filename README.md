- **MongoDB with Mongoose** for database management and schema validation
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure user authentication
- **Centralized error handling** using custom error classes and middleware
- **ESLint** for maintaining clean and consistent code
- **Postman** for API testing, including collections and environment setup
